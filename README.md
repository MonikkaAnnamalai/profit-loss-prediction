## Profit Loss Prediction

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook for profit loss prediction. The prediction model can be found in the [profit_loss.ipynb](https://nbviewer.org/github/MonikkaAnnamalai/profit-loss-prediction/blob/main/profit_loss.ipynb) file.

# Profit Loss Prediction

## Overview

This repository contains a dataset comprising information related to sales, profits, and other interesting facts of a Superstore giant. The goal of this project is to perform profit loss prediction based on the provided dataset.

## Data Preprocessing

To ensure data quality and consistency, the Jupyter Notebook `profit_loss.ipynb` has been provided. This notebook covers the following aspects:

- Handling missing values
- Addressing data mismatches
- Exploratory Data Analysis

## Analysis and Visualization

The analysis and visualization of the dataset are performed using Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The Jupyter Notebook `profit_loss.ipynb` demonstrates:

- Profit trends over time
- Correlation analysis between sales and profits
- Visualizing key metrics with Seaborn and Matplotlib

## Techniques for Visualization and Analysis

### 1. NumPy

NumPy is utilized for numerical operations and array manipulations, providing efficient data structures for handling numeric data. In our analysis, NumPy is employed for mathematical calculations and data manipulation.

### 2. Pandas

Pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis. The library provides data structures like DataFrames, making it convenient to explore, clean, and preprocess the dataset. Pandas is integral to our analysis pipeline for handling tabular data.

### 3. Matplotlib

Matplotlib is a powerful plotting library in Python. It is employed for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations. Our project uses Matplotlib for generating various plots to visualize trends and patterns in the data.

### 4. Seaborn

Seaborn is built on top of Matplotlib and provides a high-level interface for statistical data visualization. We leverage Seaborn to create informative and attractive visualizations that enhance our understanding of the Superstore giant's sales and profits.
